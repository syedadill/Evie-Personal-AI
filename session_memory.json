However, the query lacks clarity in whether the user is interested in finding such a program, seeking advice about it, or some other action. \n\nFrom the PDF data, it appears that the user, John Doe, has a daughter, Emma Doe, who may be in relevant school age.\n\nLooking at the recent Google Search results, I've found various programs and schools that focus on STEM education for middle school students. For example, there's the FOCUS camp at George Mason University for rising 6th-8th graders and Westview Middle School, a STEM focus school that emphasizes on design-thinking and problem-solving. There's also an E-STEM Middle School, which incorporates environmental education with their STEM curriculum.\n\nJohn, please could you specify your interest in the STEM programs for middle school students? For instance, are you considering enrolling Emma in such a program, or are you looking for resources or advice on the topic? Providing a bit more context will help me provide the best assistance and resources for your need."
